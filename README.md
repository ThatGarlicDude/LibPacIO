## Overview

*LibPacIO* is a shared library used for accessing and modifying the arcade versions of *Pac-Man* and *Ms. Pac-Man*. It is not a sprite or level editor, but it is a general-purpose toolbox for other programs to use and hack the games. Moreover, *LibPacIO* features functions for opening the ROM set directories for both games, as well as saving and loading the games' ROM data. In that case, *LibPacIO* is a core utility for ROM-hacking both *Pac-Man* and *Ms. Pac-Man*.

In addition to this, *LibPacIO* is also beginner-friendly. It features a couple of tutorials, like [installing the library onto your system](./docs/INSTALL.md) and [using the shared library](./docs/USAGE.md). If you want to get started with *LibPacIO* and get into *Pac-Man* ROM-hacking, these tutorials are worth looking into.
